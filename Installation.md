# Installation

###  [🏠To the main page](https://github.com/FroggerHH/Frogger-Tribe-Classes-WIKI#readme)
#### You must have BepInEx installed correctly!

* ### Windows (Steam) 
  Find the folder with your game manually or launch the Steam client and: Right-click the Valheim game in your steam library "Go to Management" -> "View local files" Steam should open the folder with your game and extract the contents of the archive. Put the DLL in BepInEx\plugins, the rest of the files are needed to upload to thunderstore and can be ignored.

* ### Server
  The mod must be installed on both the client and the server for synchronization to work correctly.
  
Extract the contents of the archive in BepInEx\plugins. 
Run your game at least once to generate the necessary configuration file, if you haven't already done so. Restart your server. All clients will now sync with the server's configuration file, even if their configuration file is different.
