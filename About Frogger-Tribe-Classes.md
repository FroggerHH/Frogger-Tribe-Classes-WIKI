# About the mod

###  [🏠To the main page](https://github.com/FroggerHH/Frogger-Tribe-Classes-WIKI#readme)

Welcome to the TribeClasses wiki!

This is a mod from me, that is, from Just a Frogger.

It adds classes to the game. Note that this is not the same as Magic Overflow.
I try to make my mod more balanced and fit into the atmosphere of the World of Walheim.
